# CVIformer
### PyTorch implementation of "CVIformer: Cross-View Interactive Transformer for Efficient Stereoscopic Image Super-Resolution"

## Highlights:
#### 1. We propose a novel stereo cross-view interactive Transformer (CVIformer), which integrates effcient residual Transformer blocks (ERTB) for longrange cross-view information extraction within linear complexity.
